Covariance matrix calculation parameters used to produced these results:

tofwidths: P=12, M=6
beamdivs: theta=0.03, phi=0.03
samplethickness = 0.0005



"Error" (distance between 'covmat' method covariance matrices, using these parameters, and the inferred covariance matrices from the mcvine resolution simulations):

avg_dist = 1376.39
min_dist = 44.79
max_dist = 5233.23
